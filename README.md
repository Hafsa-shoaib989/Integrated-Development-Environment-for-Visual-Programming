# VisCode IDE: Integrated Development Environment for Visual Programming

**VisCode IDE** is an advanced development platform that merges the intuitive visual programming capabilities of Blockly with Electron. This IDE integrates seamlessly with a Python backend, utilizing tkinter for user feedback and MySQL for database management. It features real-time updates via websockets, making it perfect for both educational and developmental experimentation in visual coding paradigms.

## Features

- **Visual Code Composition**: Effortlessly drag and drop coding blocks to construct logical sequences in a visual interface.
- **Compile and Execution**: Transforms Blockly logic into a CSV file and executes it using a Python script.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Dynamically updates Blockly block colors reflecting execution statusâ€”green for success and red for failure.
- **Database Interaction**: Manages data operations in MySQL driven by visual code logic.
- **Dynamic Path Handling**: Guarantees that all file paths are dynamic and configurable, preventing hard-coded values.
